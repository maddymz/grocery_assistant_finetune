Add the chicken to the bowl and stir until the chicken is completely coated in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet with oil. Place the chicken onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the tomato sauce and stir in the garam masala, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Simmer until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Add the cream and simmer for 5 minutes more.
